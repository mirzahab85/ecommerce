**INTRODUCTION:**
<br><br>
Is an integral part of e-business in the e-marketplace. Ordering and selling is done via the Internet.  
It is the most profitable form of trade due to its simplicity and low price.
E-commerce that takes place between two entrepreneurs is called B2B (business-to-business). They can also be open to stakeholders (commodity exchanges) or limited to retrained participants (private electronic marketplace).
E-commerce that takes place between entrepreneurs and consumers is called B2C (business-to-client). Over the Internet, the buyer is usually connected to the seller’s system, and the transaction is done directly electronically in real time.
There is a B2B2C (business-to-business-to-clinet) model that combines two modes between retailer and customer. Completion of the transaction will require the user to fill in or select a billing address, shipping address, and payment information, such as credit card or payment on delivery. An e-mail notification is sent immediately whereby the order is sent.

**BACKGROUND:**
<br><br>
E-commerce is becoming more and more popular today and especially becoming more and more popular during the covid-19 pandemic. A lot of business houses, markets, computer stores, mobile phone stores, airlines, health food stores and others have websites that provide functionality to perform commercial transactions via the web.
Today, shopping on the web is becoming more common and simpler compared to classic shopping.
E-commerce websites will better present their product to a certain user, they will sell it more before they sell it in the classic way. The central concept of the application allows customers to buy virtually using the Internet and purchase items the products they want. The products we choose to buy go in shopping carts. 
At checkout time, the items in the shopping cart will be presented as an order. This is the most important process of all e-commerce sites.

**OBJECTIVES**
<br><br>
Online shopping is considered one of the most successful forms of commerce today. The objective of e-commerce is developing a web interface for the site. 
The main goal of this website is:<br> 
    • To develop an easy to use web-based interface where customers can search for products, view a complete description of the product and order the product.<br>
    • Today, internet access is becoming commonplace and our product or service can reach almost everyone on the planet with an internet enabled device.<br>
    • Virtual stores need to be open and open 24 hours a day even if your staff is not working, this may not be entirely true if your product or service requires             urgent human intervention.<br>
    • We don’t have to maintain an entire stock of products in a web store - again this varies for different business models and will work well if you have a good           vendor that doesn’t assign defaults and a good partner or delivery team working synchronously for delivery.<br>
    • When we build our brand faster, more and more people will know and talk and publish a blog about you on social networks.<br>
    • Once your brand build, can easily diversify and pull out a certain segment if it fails with minimal losses.<br>
    • Today, creating and setting up a website as well as just maintaining it is much cheaper given the many hosting services available than before.
